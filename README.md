# briter
Simple bot to act on Eventbrite registrations

This was written to help handle volunteer signups for taBURNak! 4 in 2012.

Note that Eventbrite has a new (and much better) API, so this code won't work anymore and is unlikely to be useful as a starting point (they now have webhooks, so polling should be unnecessary).
